        <p>I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well, then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. There are dozens of us! Dozens! She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome.</p>
        <p>Why are you squeezing me with your body? Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! Speaking of settling, How's Ann? Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. Nellie is blowing them all AWAY.</p>
        <p>I know what an erection feels like, Michael. We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. It feels good to be back in a queen! Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive.</p>
